## Overview
Explain the idea of CHSH game.  Experience on simulator and real quantum computer.  Use qiskit's dynamic circuit to randomly generate input x and y.  Finally, try with superposition inputs x and y.

## Content
1. [Chapter 1](01_chsh.ipynb) Describe CHSH game and explain the idea of choosing the operators by Alice and Bob.
2. [Chapter 2](02_chsh_run_on_real_qc.ipynb) Run on real quantum computer.
3. [Chapter 3](03_chsh_superposition_input.ipynb) CHSH game with superposition inputs x and y.

## Notes
1. Run with Qiskit 1.4.0.
